I've built this site using:

- Astro
- TypeScript
- SASS

## My goal

Soon after I've started my web development journey I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build) and I knew I wanted to make my portfolio with Astro. I knew it was a fast framework and especially built for content driven sites with its [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
I took inspiration from [Chris Pennington](https://chrispennington.blog/) with [his fantasting content on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginpublic) covering Astro.
