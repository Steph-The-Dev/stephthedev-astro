# My web development portfolio website
## Description
This is my portfolio site showcasing my web development journey. I've built this site using:
- Astro
- TypeScript
- SASS
## My goal
Soon after I've started my web development journey I discovered Astro and I knew I wanted to make my portfolio with [Astro](https://astro.build). I knew it was a fast framework and especially built for content driven sites with its [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
