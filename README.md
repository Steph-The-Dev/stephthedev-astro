# My web development portfolio website

## Description

This is my [portfolio site](https://stephthedev.de/) showcasing my web development journey.

I've built this site using:

- Astro
- TypeScript
- SASS

## My goal

Soon after I've started my web development journey I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build) and I knew I wanted to make my portfolio with Astro. I knew it was a fast framework and especially built for content driven sites with its [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). I've built my blog with content collections and it's working great. IIt uses md files and auto generates the blog entries on demand.
I took inspiration from [Chris Pennington](https://chrispennington.blog/) with [his fantasting content on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginpublic) covering Astro.

## Why I've created my website

I've created this website to share my web development journey with you. I hope with time I will populate it with some useful blog entries and knowledge that you might find useful and interesting. Of course I am also looking to connect with fellow developers. And should you be someone looking for a web developer that might be a good fit, I would be happy to connect with you.
