## I finally wrote my first blog post

This blog post marks the beginning of my journey as a self-taught developer. But is it really? Of course not. The journey began way before this blog post. My decision to change careers was made almost three years ago. So this blog post is merely a stopover. I will continue to write about my journey as a self-taught developer in other blog posts.

## Why I made this site

This site's purpose is to present myself as web developer and share my experience with you. But also to find a job as a web developer. As I'm coming from being a self-taught freelance television editor and colorist, the natural progression now for me is to make the transition from one freelance career to another. I think this could be a viable way going forward but I also am equally open to other opportunities being employed.

## My journey as a self-taught developer

My journey as a self-taught developer began early 2022. At that point I had been a self-taught television editor and colorist for the last 14 years. Then I was deciding against my formal studies of Marketing Management, English and Spanish and that I would work at some marketing agency or in a marketing department of a big corporation. The creative arts always intrigued me. So I went to a small Swiss startup and became their videographer.I remember the first time when I was earning money with being a videographer. Out there with a camera and then editing all the footage myself. Before I never imagined I could live off of that. A long exhausting and exciting journey lied ahead of me. It was fantastic and I loved it.

In the meantime life happened.
