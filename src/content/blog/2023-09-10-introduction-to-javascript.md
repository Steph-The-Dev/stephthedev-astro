# Introduction to JavaScript

## Introduction

Hello again! Now that you've learned HTML and CSS, it's time to make your website interactive with JavaScript. In this article, we'll introduce you to the basics of JavaScript and how it can
enhance user experience on your web pages.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. It allows you to create dynamic content, respond to user actions, validate forms, and much more.

## Basic Syntax

JavaScript code can be written directly in HTML using `<script>` tags or linked from external files. Here’s a simple example:

```html
<script>
  document.write('Hello, world!');
</script>
```

However, it's better practice to place your JavaScript in external files and link them in the HTML.

## Variables and Data Types

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var`. For example:

```javascript
let message = 'Welcome to my website!';
const PI = 3.14;
```

JavaScript has various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Here’s a simple function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return 'Hello, ' + name;
}

console.log(greet('Alice')); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

## Events

JavaScript can respond to user actions, such as clicks or key presses, using event listeners.

```html
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function () {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  });
</script>
```

## Conclusion

With JavaScript, you can make your website more interactive and user-friendly. In the next article, we'll explore how to use frameworks like React to build more complex web applications.
