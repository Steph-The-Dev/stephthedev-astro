# Getting Started with HTML

## Introduction

Hello everyone! In this article, we're going to dive into the basics of HTML, which is the foundation of any
website. Whether you're a complete beginner or just need a refresher, this guide will help you get started on
building your first web page.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML
consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display content on the screen.

## Basic Structure

Every HTML document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element. Inside the
`<html>` tags, you'll find the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to
  stylesheets or scripts.

- **`<body>`**: Holds the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and multimedia.

## Common HTML Elements

Here are some essential HTML elements you should know:

- **Headings**: Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for different levels of headings. `<h1>` is the highest level, while `<h6>`
  is the lowest.

- **Paragraphs**: Wrap text in `<p>` tags to create paragraphs.

- **Links**: Create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag. For example:

  ```html
  <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
  ```

- **Images**: Insert images with the `<img>` tag, specifying the source and alternative text:

  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image" />
  ```
