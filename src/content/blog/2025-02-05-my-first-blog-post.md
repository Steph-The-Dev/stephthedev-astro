## I finally wrote my first blog post

This blog post marks the beginning of my journey as a self-taught developer â€” or does it? In reality, my journey began long before this post. I made the decision to change careers almost three years ago, at the beginning of 2022. So, this blog post is merely a stopover. I will continue to share my experiences as a self-taught developer in future posts.

## Why I made this site

The purpose of this site is to present myself as a web developer and share my experiences with you. Coming from a background as a self-taught freelance television editor and colorist, transitioning to another freelance career feels like a natural progression. I believe this could be a viable path forward, but I am also open to employment opportunities.

## Coming up

The site is still a work in progress, but I am quite happy with how far I've come. In one of my next posts, I will delve into the technical aspects of this site. I am also about to finish my first client project and will share that experience with you in upcoming posts.
