# Understanding CSS

## Introduction

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's used to describe the presentation of an HTML document, including
colors, layout, fonts, and more. CSS separates content from presentation, making it easier to maintain and

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

- **Selector**: The HTML element you want to style.

- **Property**: The aspect of the element you're styling (e.g., color, font-size).

- **Value**: The specific value for the property.

## Common Properties

Here are some commonly used CSS properties:

- **Color**: Sets the text color.

  ```css
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

- **Font-Family**: Specifies the font type.

  ```css
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  ```

- **Background**: Sets background colors or images.

  ```css
  body {
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
  ```

- **Margin and Padding**: Control spacing around elements.

  ```css
  div {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
  }
  ```
