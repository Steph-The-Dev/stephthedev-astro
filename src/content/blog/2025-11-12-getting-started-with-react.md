## My journey as a self-taught developer

My journey as a self-taught developer began early 2022. At that point I had been a self-taught television editor and colorist for the last 14 years. Then I was deciding against my formal studies of Marketing Management, English and Spanish and that I would work at some marketing agency or in a marketing department of a big corporation. The creative arts always intrigued me. So I went to a small Swiss startup and became their videographer.I remember the first time when I was earning money with being a videographer. Out there with a camera and then editing all the footage myself. Before I never imagined I could live off of that. A long exhausting and exciting journey lied ahead of me. It was fantastic and I loved it.

In the meantime life happened.
