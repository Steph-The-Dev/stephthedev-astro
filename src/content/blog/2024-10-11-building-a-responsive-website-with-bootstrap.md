# Building a Responsive Website with Bootstrap

## Introduction

In this article, we're going to learn how to create a responsive website using Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that simplifies the process of building mobile-friendly
websites.

## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is an open-source framework for designing and developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It includes pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components, making it easier to build consistent
and visually appealing interfaces.

## Setting Up Bootstrap

To use Bootstrap in your project, you can include it via CDN or download the files. Hereâ€™s how to add it using a CDN:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Bootstrap Site</title>
    <link
      href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>
    </div>

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Grid System

Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout. You can create responsive layouts by combining different
classes.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-md-6">Column 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Components

Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, cards, forms, and modals.

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>

<div class="card">
  <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Card image" />
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
